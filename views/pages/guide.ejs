                            <p>When you are in the game the first thing you do is locate the spiral. This isn't hard since the spiral will always been exactly in the middle (I know this because I programmed it that way). The Spiral is important because it is the goal that you will be trying to get all the pucks to</p>

                    <p>First let me tell you alittle about PuckPuck. PuckPuck was inspired in part by pool (or billard balls if you prefer) and angry birds. You are probably saying to your self "I can see the pool inspiration but I don't see anything relating to angry birds?". You would not be wrong in thinking that. Over the course of building the app any ties the game did have to angry birds ended up getting cut. Which is really a shame because there were some good ones. </p>
